This file was created to try if a repo can be reseted.
At this time, this repo still had the good old `master` base branch.

- Did create an empty folder.
- Added this file.
- Ran `git init`
- Ran `git remote add origin {this repo url}`
- Pushed `push -u origin main`
- Made `main` the new base branch. Could possibly remove the old `master` branch which is not merged.

So commit history is lost â†’ Seems we can reset a repo.
